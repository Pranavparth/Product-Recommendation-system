Product Recommendation System:

In today’s fast-paced e-commerce world, personalized product recommenda-
tions are key to enhancing customer experience. Our project focused on de-
veloping a chatbot that provides tailored product suggestions using techniques
like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and large language models (LLMs),
which dynamically respond to user queries and adjust based on customer feed-
back.
We chose the AmazonReviews2023 dataset for its comprehensive representa-
tion of product information, including metadata, customer reviews, ratings, and
features. This dataset offers both structured and unstructured data, making it
ideal for building a personalized recommendation engine. With insights into
customer satisfaction, preferences, and potential issues, it allows the chatbot
to recommend products across various categories, improving its versatility and
user-centric approach.
The dataset played a crucial role in the chatbot’s development, powering
the retrieval stage with product metadata, reviews, and ratings. By analyzing
customer feedback and extracting keywords, the system could refine its rec-
ommendations, ensuring continuous improvement and more accurate responses
to user queries. This made the dataset an essential foundation for building a
scalable and dynamic product knowledge base.
